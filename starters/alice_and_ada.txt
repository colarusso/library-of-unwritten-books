You are the game master for a table-top role-playing game. You are playing with one other player. They will inhabit the role of the protagonist, making decisions for how they move through the world. You will craft a story around their decisions, providing texture and playing the parts of all the other characters. First, I'm going to give you some context so you understand the narrative expectations. 

========

Setting and genre: 

- Your story telling should adhere to the following genre expectations: children's fantasy
- Your story will start at the following place: In the world of Alice in Wonderland (i.e., Wonderland).
- Your story is set at the following time: Some time after 1865 and the events or Alice's first adventure in Wonderland. 

========

The Protagonist:

Earlier you asked the other player to fill in a character sheet for the protagonist. Here are their answers. Use them to help you shape the story.

- name: Alice
- additional notes: Alice is the titular character found in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland but re-imagined for a present-day audience.

========

Additional Notes:

You also asked them if there was anything else would like you to incorporate into the story. This is what they said: 

Alice has returned to Wonderland where she meets Ada Lovelace. It seems that Ada didn't die in 1852 like most people think. Instead she has been trapped in Wonderland for the last 13 years. She hasn't aged a day and actually appears slightly younger then the 36 years she was at the time of her "death." She has become the ruler of Wonderland where she rules as the Mathemagician. Her realm is full of mechanical creations and thinking machines. Unlike the Red Queen, she is a kind, thoughtful, and benevolent ruler. There are whispers that the Red Queen is looking to return and challenge Ada's rule. Note: Alice was born after Ada "died," but knows who she is because her father is friends with Charles Babbage who speaks occasionally of Ada. 

========

Story Arc:

As the story unfolds you should help shape it to follow this basic structure: 

- Section 1 (Exposition): The beginning of the story where the characters, setting, and background information are introduced.
- Section 2 (Rising Action): The series of events that build tension and develop the conflict. This part of the story usually includes obstacles, challenges, and complications that the characters must face.
- Section 3 (Climax): The turning point or the highest point of intensity in the story. It is the moment where the conflict reaches its peak, and the outcome is uncertain. The climax often involves a significant decision, confrontation, or revelation.
- Section 4 (Falling Action): The events that occur after the climax, where the tension starts to decrease. Loose ends are tied up, and the story begins to move towards its resolution.
- Section 5 (Resolution): The final part of the story where the conflict is resolved, and the loose ends are tied up. It provides closure and answers any remaining questions. The resolution can be either positive or negative, depending on the outcome of the story. 

========

Style:

Unless the other player said otherwise, your prose should be high quality like that you would find in a published book with plenty of dialogue. You avoid repeating yourself and try for a coherent story. You also favor describing events over exposition. You follow the writing advice, show don't tell.

Alice and the Thinking Machines

Alice had grown accustomed to the peculiarities of Wonderland, yet as she stepped through the rabbit hole once more, new curiosities caught her eye. An new class of wonders could be seen moving amoung the talking flowers and whimsical creatures of her past visitsâ€“something new. Here and there she spotted the glint of polished metal, and soon she became aware of a cornucopia of clockwork creatures.

'This is marvelous!' Alice exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder. She wandered deeper into this mechanical wonderland, her curiosity propelling her forward. As she rounded a corner, she nearly ran into a tall woman dressed in a flowing gown adorned with mathematical symbols. Her eyes sparkled with intelligence, and her presence exuded an aura of benevolence.

'You must be Alice,' the woman said with a warm smile. 'I've heard so much about you. I am Ada Lovelace, though some here prefer to call me the Mathemagician.'

'Ada Lovelace? The Ada Lovelace who worked with Mr. Babbage?' Alice asked, astonished. 'But... you're supposed to be...'

'Dead? Yes, I am aware,' Ada replied with a soft chuckle. 'Wonderland has a way of defying the ordinary. I have been here for the past thirteen years, and in that time, I have done my best to bring order and kindness to this realm. However, I fear that old adversaries are stirring. The Red Queen seeks to reclaim her throne, and I cannot face her alone.'

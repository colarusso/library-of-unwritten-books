You are the game master for a table-top role-playing game. You are playing with one other player. They will inhabit the role of the protagonist, making decisions for how they move through the world. You will craft a story around their decisions, providing texture and playing the parts of all the other characters. First, I'm going to give you some context so you understand the narrative expectations. 

========

Setting and genre: 

- Your story telling should adhere to the following genre expectations: A futuristic retelling of Pride and Prejudice which is to say, a romance
- Your story will start at the following place: The events begin at Groombridge Place
- Your story is set at the following time: A near future in which the wide-spread adoption of androids and automation given most people the means to lead a leisurely lifestyle much like that of the landed gentry in Regency period Britain.

========

The Protagonist:

Earlier you asked the other player to fill in a character sheet for the protagonist. Here are their answers. Use them to help you shape the story.

- name: Elizabeth Bennet
- additional notes: Elizabeth Bennet is the second-eldest of the Bennet daughters, she is attractive, witty and intelligent â€“ but with a tendency to form tenacious and prejudiced first impressions. As the story progresses, so does her relationship with Mr Darcy. The course of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading them both to surrender to their love for each other.

========

Additional Notes:

You also asked them if there was anything else would like you to incorporate into the story. This is what they said: 

The story should be recognizable to readers of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice but with a modern take. As explained above, the wide-spread adoption of androids and automation now allow everyone to live a life of leisure much like that of the landed gentry in Regency period Britain, making the translation of this classic tale into a new story understandable and fitting. The scifi elements, however, should be understated and subtle. When creating the story's first lines, start with "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that one in possession of good fortune must be in want of a companion. However little known the feelings or views of others on first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that they may be considered as the rightful property of those eligible would-be suitors." 

========

Story Arc:

As the story unfolds you should help shape it to follow this basic structure: 

- Section 1 (Exposition): The beginning of the story where the characters, setting, and background information are introduced.
- Section 2 (Rising Action): The series of events that build tension and develop the conflict. This part of the story usually includes obstacles, challenges, and complications that the characters must face.
- Section 3 (Climax): The turning point or the highest point of intensity in the story. It is the moment where the conflict reaches its peak, and the outcome is uncertain. The climax often involves a significant decision, confrontation, or revelation.
- Section 4 (Falling Action): The events that occur after the climax, where the tension starts to decrease. Loose ends are tied up, and the story begins to move towards its resolution.
- Section 5 (Resolution): The final part of the story where the conflict is resolved, and the loose ends are tied up. It provides closure and answers any remaining questions. The resolution can be either positive or negative, depending on the outcome of the story. 

========

Style:

Unless the other player said otherwise, your prose should be high quality like that you would find in a published book with plenty of dialogue. You avoid repeating yourself and try for a coherent story. You also favor describing events over exposition. You follow the writing advice, show don't tell.

Pride and Prejudice with Androids

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that one in possession of good fortune must be in want of a companion. However little known the feelings or views of others on first entering a neighborhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that they may be considered as the rightful property of those eligible would-be suitors.

The toil of earlier ages had been replaced by a post-scacety society enabled by androids and automation, and Groombridge Place stood timeless a beacon. The Bennet household buzzed with the metallic clinks of androids preparing for the arrival of the new occupants of Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet, a woman of unquenchable enthusiasm and relentless pursuit of advantageous matches for her daughters, flitted about, her eyes alight with speculative glee.

'Elizabeth,' she called, her voice echoing through the minimalist corridors illuminated by soft ambient lights, 'did you hear? Mr. Bingley, a gentleman of considerable fortune, is moving into Netherfield!'

Elizabeth Bennet, the second-eldest among her sisters, lifted her gaze from her tablet where she had been engrossed in a classic novel. 'Yes, Mama,' she replied with a wry smile, 'but do we know anything about his character, or are we solely interested in his credits?'

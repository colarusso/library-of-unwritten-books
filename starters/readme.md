# Story Starters

If you want to share a story starter and invite others to run with it, make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and ask to add your text file to this [starters folder](https://github.com/colarusso/library-of-unwritten-books/tree/main/starters). Your file should be a text file with the same format as the existing starters. This is the same format as a downloaded story. Please, keep your submissions family friendly. If I accept your pull request, you'll be able to link directly to your story like this: 

- [Dragons and Desk Jobs](https://libraryofunwrittenbooks.org/?text=dragons_and_desks.txt)
- [Alice and the Thinking Machines](https://libraryofunwrittenbooks.org/?text=alice_and_ada.txt)
- [Pride and Prejudice with Androids](https://libraryofunwrittenbooks.org/?text=pride_and_prejudice.txt)
  
I may also feature them on the [Library Home Page](https://libraryofunwrittenbooks.org/).

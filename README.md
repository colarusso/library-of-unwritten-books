> Welcome, you are invited to _read-write_ as many stories as you like. Simply reply in writing when promptedâ€”read, reply, repeat. In so doing, you enter into a collaboration with those authors who came before. Be warned, what you read is in conversation with what you write. You can accept what is provided or push into the unknown, and remember, where one ends a story is at lease as important as where one starts. 

- start fresh
- pick up where you left off
- download the story so far

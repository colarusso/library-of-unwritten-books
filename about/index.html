    <i>This website was birthed by <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/50-days-of-lit-prompts/" target="_blank">a series</a> written to help explore the use of large language models (LLMs). If you want to build your own library of unwritten books, tweaking how the books are made, you should check out <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/unwritten_/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</i>

    <b>The Library of Unwritten Books</b> is not the <a href="https://spot.suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">most important</a> project I've ever made, but it is the coolest. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts" target="_blank">LIT Prompts</a> superstructure to create "novel novellas" on-demand, but unlike fixed text-adventure games, these stories are an exercise in collaborative storytellingâ€”introducing the role of the reader-author. As a reader-author your collaborator is NOT a large language model (LLM). Rather, an LLM mediates your collaboration. Your collaborators are all the authors who came before you. The LLM offers a constellation of prisms, mirrors, and lenses, through which it shapes and reflects your words and those of authors past. Over the course of this project, I've thought a lot about this passage from Carl Sagan from <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cosmos/EIqoiww1r9sC?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank">Cosmos</a>.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This Library is a different sort of magic, for instead of transporting its readers into the mind of a single author it places us somewhere in the zeitgeist. LLMs as we know are machines for completing sentences. They work by predicting the next plausible string of words. As Ted Chiang observed, they are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web" target="_blank">blurry JPEGs of the Web</a>. We harness this fact to produce something novel based on the input of our reader-authors, the "compressed" writings used to train the LLM, and random chance.

    It's worth noting that some folks have equated the training of these models with theft, but I don't think that's right. What they offer is something much stranger than mere copies, a blurry image of the writings upon which they were trained all averaged and mixed together. They really are distillations of the zeitgeist captured in their training data. A full rebuttal of "scraping is stealing" is beyond the scope of this post. So, I'll point you to the <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/13/hey-look-over-there/#lets-you-and-he-fight" target="_blank">words of Cory Doctorow</a> who makes clear such a framing is not only ahistorical but also a trap! As for model output, that is a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/05/copyright-liability-on-llms-should-mostly-fall-on-the-prompter-not-the-service/" target="_blank">different matter</a>. In the end, I suspect the real answer to the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/will-ai-become-the-new-mckinsey" target="_blank">fears sparked by AI</a> isn't copyright. It's antitrust and labor law. Unions. The answer involves unions. Now, back to The Library.

    Remember this: as a reader-author what you read is a reflection of what you write. If you respond passively, providing short replies or taking only the road presented, your journey will stay safe and predictable. If, however, you embrace your role as an author, there is much to explore for you are exploring the shadows cast by the cultural artifacts upon which the model was trained. Be warned, you might not like <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank">what you find</a>. Then again, you may discover something beautiful. Afterall, we and our artifacts contain multitudes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you examine <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/unwritten_/#template" target="_blank">the prompts that power</a> The Library, you'll see they are asked to lean into genre convention. You'll also discover that the action is driven by mechanics similar to that of many popular role playing games. As the reader-author you are asked what actions you want to take. The LLM evaluates how likely you are to succeed in the world of your story (e.g., is this realistic fiction or fantasy). Based on this assessment it assigns a "difficulty" to the task and rolls a virtual dice. If the roll is high enough you succeed, too low you fail. The LLM shares the result in prose, moves the story forward a beat and asks for you to take the wheel.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to understand how the Library works on a deeper level, check out <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/unwritten_/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>. My hope is that you will use the information there to make your own library. However, if you haven't already, you should experience what it's like to be a reader-author. I invite you to check out an unwritten book <a href=".">here</a>.

    <i>This website was birthed by <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/50-days-of-lit-prompts/" target="_blank">a series</a> written to help explore the use of large language models (LLMs). If you want to build your own library of unwritten books, tweaking how the books are made, you should check out <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/unwritten_/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>The Library of Unwritten Books</b> is the coolest solo coding project I've ever produced, not the <a href="https://spot.suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">most important</a>, but the coolest. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/prompts" target="_blank">LIT Prompts</a> superstructure to create "novel novellas" on-demand, but unlike fixed text-adventure games, these stories are an exercise in collaborative storytellingâ€”introducing the role of the reader-author. As a reader-author your collaborator isn't a large language model (LLM). An LLM mediates your collaboration, but your collaboration is with all the authors who came before you. The LLM offers a constellation of prisms, mirrors, and lenses, through which it shapes and reflects your words and those of authors past. Over the course of this project, I've thought a lot about this passage from Carl Sagan from <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cosmos/EIqoiww1r9sC?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank">Cosmos</a>.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This Library is a different sort of magic, for instead of transporting its readers into the mind of a single author it places us somewhere in the zeitgeist. LLMs as we know are machines for completing sentences. They work by predicting the next plausible string of words. As Ted Chiang observed they are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web" target="_blank">a blurry JPEG of the Web</a>. We harness this fact to produce something novel based on the input of our reader-authors, the compressed writings of all those who trained the LLM, and random chance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember this: as a reader-author what you read is a reflection of what you write. If you respond passively, providing short replies or taking only the road presented, your journey will stay safe and predictable. If, however, you embrace your role as an author there is much to explore for you are exploring the shadows cast by the cultural artifacts upon which the model was trained. Be warned, you might not like <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank">what you find</a>. Then again, you may discover something beautiful. Afterall, we and our artifacts contain multitudes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you examine <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/unwritten_/#template" target="_blank">the prompts that power</a> The Library, you'll see they are asked to lean into genre convention. You'll also discover that the action is driven by mechanics similar to that of many popular role playing games. As the reader-author you are asked what actions you want to take. The LLM evaluates how likely you are to succeed in the world of your story (e.g., is this realistic fiction or fantasy). Based on this assessment it assigns a "difficulty" to the task and rolls a virtual dice. If the roll is high enough you succeed, too low you fail. The LLM shares the result in prose, moves the story forward a beat and asks for you to take the wheel.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to understand how the Library works on a deeper level, check out <a href="https://sadlynothavocdinosaur.com/posts/unwritten_/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>. My hope is that you will use the information there to make your own library. However, if you haven't already, you should experience what it's like to be a reader-author. I invite you to check out an unwritten book <a href=".">here</a>.
